# MX² — MAX to eXcryption Container

> **Status:** Draft / Work in progress.  
> This repository contains the official documentation and reference implementation of the MX² format.

MX² (“MX squared”) stands for **MAX to eXcryption** and defines the
**deterministic cryptographic container** used inside the MAX ecosystem
to securely store a high-entropy secret (typically two long passphrases)
from which an entire mathematical identity is reconstructed  
(MX² → MAX-ID → SPHINCS+ → FrodoKEM → Chat/Lock/Login).

MX² is:

- **Deterministic** — same secret + same version = identical result.  
- **Portable** — can be stored as a text string or encoded into a QR code.  
- **Auditable** — experts can inspect every field of the format.  
- **Built on standard primitives** — Argon2id + XChaCha20-Poly1305.  
- **Independent** — reveals nothing about the proprietary MAX-ID logic.  

📌 **MX² is Level 2 of the “MAX to eXcryption” model:**  
- **Level 1** → mathematical theory (paper published on Zenodo)  
- **Level 2** → this cryptographic container (MX²)  
- **Level 3** → implementations (MAX App, MAX OS, MAX SDK, etc.)

## 🔧 High-level structure

An MX² container looks like this:

```text
MX2:PC:V1|salt_b64|nonce_b64|tag_b64|ciphertext_b64
```

Where:

- `MX2:PC:V1` → format header  
- `salt_b64`  → Argon2id salt (Base64)  
- `nonce_b64` → XChaCha20-Poly1305 nonce (Base64)  
- `tag_b64`   → AEAD authentication tag  
- `ciphertext_b64` → encrypted payload (e.g., internal JSON)

## 🧠 Why MX²?

MX² solves a fundamental problem:  
**how to store a high-entropy secret in a portable and verifiable way**,  
without sending it to any server and without cloud sync, accounts, or profiles.

MX² is the **cryptographic key-container** of the MAX ecosystem.

## 📱 How MX² is used inside the MAX App

The MAX App uses MX² to locally reconstruct:

- the **MAX-ID** (mathematical identity based on deterministic prime structures)  
- the **SPHINCS+** private key for password-less Login  
- the **FrodoKEM** keypair for post-quantum Chat  
- all internal module keys (Chat, Lock, Signature, Prime)

No private data or passphrases ever leave the device.

## 🔬 Independent verification (Hugging Face)

SPHINCS+ signatures generated by the MAX App can be verified publicly
through the official verification service (Hugging Face Space):

👉 *(link will be added when the repository becomes public)*

This allows cryptographers to confirm that signatures truly originate  
from the mathematical identity derived via MX².

## 📚 Relation with Zenodo

The official Zenodo papers describe:

1. the MAX Prime Theory  
2. the irreversibility of the mathematical parameters (“MAX to eXcryption”)  
3. deterministic prime generation  

MX² is the **practical bridge** between theory and real cryptographic use.
