## 1. Introduction

MX² (“MAX 2 eXcryption”) is a **portable, password-protected container format** for encrypting long-term, high-entropy secret phrases.

MX² is:
- **open**
- **verifiable**
- **ASCII-safe**
- **fully reproducible**
- **based exclusively on standardized cryptography**

The format is intentionally minimal and suitable for:
- file storage
- text encoding
- QR encoding
- cross-platform interoperability

This document defines:
- the **MX2:PC:V1** container format
- the internal JSON record **(MAXREC)**
- the password-based encryption mechanism
- the normative requirements for compliant implementations.


## 1.1. Security Model (High-Level Overview)

MX² uses a simple but powerful **three-layer trust model**:
```
        [1] Password (user secret)
                     │
                     ▼
        [2] MX² Container (encrypted vault)
                     │
                     ▼
        [3] Secret Phrases p1, p2 (root secrets)
```

**[1] Password**

- The only value the user must remember.
- It **does not** generate the secret phrases.
- It merely derives the key that unlocks the container.

**[2] MX² Container**

- An encrypted structure holding a JSON record (“MAXREC”).
- The container is portable and platform-agnostic.

**[3] Secret Phrases (p1, p2)**

Two long, high-entropy strings stored inside MAXREC.

These phrases act as the **root secret** from which applications may deterministically derive:

- encryption keys
- authentication keys
- identity keys
- post-quantum keypairs
- recovery or migration seeds

MX² **does not** prescribe any derivation mechanism — this is left to applications.

MX² only defines:

> a secure, auditable, password-protected container  
> for storing p1 and p2.


## 1.2. Why MX² Is Different

Most cryptographic systems:

- store keys directly in a vault,
- derive one deterministic key from a password, or
- use a seed phrase tied to one specific ecosystem.

MX² introduces a different model:

> **A portable, password-protected container that stores two high-entropy secret phrases from  
> which unlimited deterministic keys can be derived — for any purpose and on any implementation.**

The password only opens the vault. 
The phrases are the root secret.

MX² guarantees:

- **no private keys stored on disk**
- **unlimited key derivations from a single root**
- **long-term recoverability**
- **complete auditability**
- **interoperability** across independent implementations


## 2. Normative Keywords

The following terms are to be interpreted as defined in RFC 2119:

- **MUST, MUST NOT**
- **SHOULD, SHOULD NOT**
- **MAY**


## 3. Design Goals

A compliant implementation MUST satisfy:

- **Portability** — MX² must be representable as an ASCII-safe string.
- **Interoperability** — any implementation must be able to decrypt payloads generated by others.
- **Transparency** — MX² must use only standardized, public cryptographic primitives.
- **Minimalism** — the format must contain no unnecessary metadata.
- **Security** — secrecy of p1 and p2 must rely on password strength and modern primitives.


## 4. Container Format Overview

An MX² container MUST use the following structure:

```text
MX2:PC:V1|salt_b64|nonce_b64|tag_b64|ciphertext_b64
```

Fields MUST be separated by the ASCII | character.

All fields except the header MUST be base64-encoded.

## 5. Field Definitions

**5.1 Header**

Literal value:

```text
MX2:PC:V1
```

Meaning:

- **MX2**: container family
- **PC**: Portable Container
- **V1**: version 1 of the format

Implementations MUST reject containers with an unknown version.

**5.2 salt_b64**

- Base64 encoding of the Argon2id salt
- MUST be 16–32 bytes (16 recommended)
- MUST be unique per container

**5.3 nonce_b64**

- Base64 encoding of the XChaCha20 nonce
- MUST be exactly 24 bytes
- MUST be generated from a secure RNG
- MUST NOT repeat under the same key

**5.4 tag_b64**

- Base64 encoding of the 16-byte Poly1305 authentication tag

**5.5 ciphertext_b64**

- Base64 encoding of the AEAD ciphertext
- MUST contain a JSON document (MAXREC)
- MUST be produced using XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD

## 6. Internal JSON Payload (MAXREC)

The decrypted payload MUST be valid UTF-8 JSON.

```
MAXREC = {
  "type": "MAXREC",         // MUST be literal "MAXREC"
  "v": <uint>,              // version of the record
  "ts": <uint>,             // timestamp (seconds)
  "p1": <string>,           // secret phrase 1
  "p2": <string>,           // secret phrase 2
  "meta": { ... } OPTIONAL  // non-normative
}
```

**Requirements:**

- `type` MUST be "MAXREC".
- `p1` and `p2` MUST be high-entropy phrases (length ≥ 64 chars recommended).
- `meta` MAY contain arbitrary non-critical fields.
- Implementations MUST ignore unknown fields.


## 7. Cryptographic Process (Normative)

The MX² encryption pipeline consists of:

1. Password preprocessing
2. Key derivation
3. AEAD encryption
4. Assembly of the MX² container

**7.1 Password Preprocessing**

The password MUST be processed into two internal passcodes.

A compliant scheme is:

```text
pass1 = SHA-256(password || "1")
pass2 = SHA-256(password || "2")
```

Other domain-separated SHA-256 constructions MAY be used.

**7.2 Key Derivation (Argon2id)**

The encryption key MUST be derived using Argon2id with parameters:

- memory: 64 MiB
- iterations: 3
- parallelism: 1
- output: 32 bytes

Formally:

```text
key32 = Argon2id(pass1, salt, memory=64MiB, iterations=3, parallelism=1)
```

`pass2` MAY be used by applications for additional domain separation but is not used by MX² itself.

**7.3 AEAD Encryption (XChaCha20-Poly1305)**

Plaintext: UTF-8 JSON (MAXREC)

Associated Data (AAD):

```text
"MAX|MX2|PC|V1"
```

Nonce: 24 random bytes (MUST NOT repeat for the same key)

Output:

```text
ciphertext, tag = XChaCha20-Poly1305_Encrypt(key32, nonce, plaintext, AAD)
```

**7.4 Assembly**

The final MX² container MUST be constructed as:

```text
MX2:PC:V1|salt_b64|nonce_b64|tag_b64|ciphertext_b64
```


## 8. Determinism

**MX² is not deterministic as an encryption scheme.**

- The **format** and **key derivation** are deterministic.
- The final **ciphertext is randomized** because of nonce + salt.

Thus:

- Two MX² containers created from the same inputs MUST differ.
- Implementations MUST NOT reuse nonce or salt.

This follows AEAD best practices.


## 9. Security Considerations (Non-Normative)

- MX² does not contain private keys — only root secrets.  
- p1 and p2 MUST be treated as highly sensitive values.  
- MX² MUST be stored and transmitted securely.  
- JSON payloads MUST NOT include derivable private keys.  
- Changing p1 or p2 requires generating a new MX² container.  
- The security of MX² depends on password strength and Argon2id parameters.
